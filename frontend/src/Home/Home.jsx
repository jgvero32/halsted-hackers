                In this graph displaying sudden unexplained infant deaths (SUIDs) by Race, one important trend to note is that every Demographic
                experienced an increase in SUIDs since 2020, which correlates to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Safety Pinpoint aims to encourage
                new mothers to vaccinate their children as well as help them keep track of their child's vaccinations to help counteract this trend.
